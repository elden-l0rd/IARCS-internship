I definitely lack in experience and domain knowledge. I was unsure of any other clustering techniques other than the more generic ones taught in school.

Recognising a gap in my competency, I found the DBSCAN clustering technique that I wanted to learn how to use.
In my final work, I included visuals to compare DBSCAN with the ones that I am already using and explained how different the former works and why it might be better in my use case.

I had to do some research to find out what others there are and which ones are useful for me. I used the more common websites that the community trusts to search for the information I needed. I also searched on GitHub and check out how others have implemented it and the results that are obtained.

At the end of the day, there are meetings with my supervisor to get feedback about my work, such as how else I can approach the problem.
