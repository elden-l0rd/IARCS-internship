Understanding organisational culture is important as it influences the employees morale and productivity. The organisation is hierarchical but in office everyone is rather amicable like a relatively flat hierarchy. A team has at least 5 people each have different tasks focused on a different part of the project. The dress code is fairly relaxed, smart casual for everyone. Decisions are made by the team leaders who are the lead researchers for the project, and the more important decisions like funding is decided by the senior faculty. Working culture is fairly relaxed as long as there are results produced whilst they follow a 50% WFH policy. People usually lunch together with everyone in the office, there are not many people in office due to the WFH policy. Working environment is quite conducive and a great place to work at.
