\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Week7: Experimenting with Llama 2 \& different training technqiues}

The main goals achieved this week are:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{7.1} Retraining model5 from the previous week using a smaller training set and larger test set
    \item \textbf{7.2} Training a separate models for each category and combining them into a single model
    \item \textbf{7.3} Prompt engineering results on Llama 2
    \item \textbf{7.4} Found a \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07316.pdf}{Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)} model to try
    \item \textit{misc.} Reformatted the original Jupyter files (.ipynb) into Python files (.py) for easier integration with Docker containers
\end{itemize}
